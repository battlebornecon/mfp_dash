# mfp_dash
MFP Dash contains two different pieces that can be used separately: A Jupyter Notebook to provide EDA and statistical analysis of MFP data, and a Python script to create a dashboard using MFP data to view weight and calorie intake by day, macro distribution by meal, and allow users to drill into entries for the day. Both are dependent on coddingtonbear's MyFitnessPal library on GitHub, which is included in the requirements.txt. The goal of both the notebook and the dashboard is to provide a visual and statistical analysis of nutrition data that can be used by anyone.
